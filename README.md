# Angel Gabriel Manzano Contreras' Porfolio

#### Frontend Developer | UX/UI Designer | P-TECH (IBM) - 2nd Generation

In 2022, I had the opportunity to participate in Codellege (Softteck), where I delved into innovative approaches for envisioning, strategizing, and fostering collaborative environments.

My journey toward professional growth began in 2021 when I joined the P-TECH IBM program. Here, I've actively dedicated myself to enhancing both my technical prowess and soft skills. Through mentorship, collaborative project development, and coursework at SkillsBuild, I continuously strive to expand my knowledge and abilities.
